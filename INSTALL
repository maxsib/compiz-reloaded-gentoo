Put the compiz-reloaded folder in your local overlay.

You might need to do this if portage complains:
# echo "compiz-reloaded" >> /etc/portage/categories

Put the keywords file for the version you want to install in your /etc/portage/package.keywords/

Have a look at the pakcage.use files in case you want to use them as well.

Remove all previously installed compiz related stuff -- These ebuild don't yet do any blocking of other packages 
so you wil get package collisions and frightening unstable computer-frying results if you don't... well either 
that or portage just won't merge it...

And finally...

# emerge -av compiz-reloaded/compiz-reloaded-meta
